# About
[Uguu.se](http://uguu.se) source code, stores files and deletes after X amount of time.

# Install
Tested with:
* Nginx+PHP5-FPM (PHP 5.4) on Debian 7 Wheezy 
* Apache (PHP 5.4) on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Nginx+PHP5-FPM (PHP 5.6) on Debian 8 Jessie

Modify 
* core.php on where to save the files (line 4) and the prepend to the uploaded URL (line 26)
* Cron with check.sh: `crontab -e` 
* Some extensions are blocked by default, this can be changed via includes/core.php's $block array.
* Everything else to your likings.

Change php.ini and nginx.conf settings to allow bigger uploads.

Make the uguu/ directory modifiable to the nginx user:
`setfacl -m u:www-data:rwx /path/to/uguu/directory/`

# Todo

* Restructure files.
* Make global config file.
* Probably a lot of things but I'm a lazy fuck, come with suggestions.


# Using the API

  Be sure to set a user agent, otherwise CF might reject you as malicious.

  Leaving POST value 'name' empty will cause it to save using the original filename.
  Leaving POST value 'randomname' empty will cause it to use original filename or custom name if 'name' is set to file.ext.
  
  Putting anything into POST value 'randomname' will cause it to return a random filename + ext (xxxxxx.ext).
  Putting a custom name into POST value 'name' will cause it to return a custom filename (yourpick.ext).
  
  E.g:
  
  curl -i -F name=test.jpg -F file=@localfile.jpg http://uguu.se/api.php?d=upload (HTML Response)
  
  curl -i -F name=test.jpg -F file=@localfile.jpg http://uguu.se/api.php?d=upload-tool (Plain text Response)


This will probably get changed later since it's messy and unpractical.
